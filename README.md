# Smart dive triangulation

## Project description
The smart dive project consists in determining water measures in depth thanks to a sensor fixed on the bottles of a scuba diver. To locate the GPS coordinates of the diver and associate it with it's depth, it is necessary to triangulate his position with three gps endpoints at the surface that locate the diver with underwater ultrasounds. 

## Program objective
This python script gathers the data from the diver's and GPS endpoints, aggregates tham and perform this calculation to return the correct coordinates of the diver, associated with each measure.
